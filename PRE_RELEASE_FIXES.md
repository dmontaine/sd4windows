# PRE-RELEASE FIXES

Defects and gaps found **while writing the documentation**, which need deciding
or fixing before W1.0-0 is released. Started 26 Aug 2026.

**This file is maintained, not written once.** Add an entry when the
documentation work turns something up; move it to DONE with a date and the
commit when it is fixed.

***IT LISTS WHAT WE WOULD SHIP, NOT WHOSE FAULT IT IS.*** Owner's correction,
26 Aug 2026. [UPSTREAM_FIXES.md](UPSTREAM_FIXES.md) answers a different
question — *the maintainer of `sdb64` should know about this* — and **a defect
in both trees belongs in both files.** Being upstream's bug has never been a
reason to ship it, and being fixed upstream is not being fixed here. Entries
11 to 13 below are exactly that case and were missed for a day by a rule that
said otherwise.

**Why a separate file.** Writing a reference forces every claim to be checked
against what SD actually does, which is a different exercise from testing that
it works. Most of what follows was found by trying to write a true sentence.

`SEV` is the recommendation, not a ruling: **B** blocks the release, **S**
should be fixed, **M** minor.

| | SEV | what | where |
|---|---|---|---|
| ~~1~~ | **B** | ~~The `edit` / `micro` refusal message is malformed~~ — **DONE 27 Aug 2026** | `sdsys/gpl.bp/EDIT` |
| ~~2~~ | **B** | ~~The installing user gets no `OS.EXECUTE`~~ — **DONE 27 Aug 2026** | `sdsys/gpl.bp/CREATEA` |
| 3 | **S** | The live `SDSYS` VOC does not match `voc_template` | `sdsys/voc_template` |
| 4 | **S** | Tester page 07 says a standard account has 77 verbs; it has 81 | docs repo |
| 5 | **S** | `.d name` cannot find a lower-case VOC record typed in upper case | `CPROC:1119` |
| 6 | **S** | An empty directory called `C:` is created in the data tree by the installer | `gplbld/sd.iss` |
| 7 | **M** | `sort.item` is withheld from a standard account and `list.item` is not | `newvoc/TIER.OMIT.STANDARD` |
| 8 | **M** | `help` is an empty stub and F1 reaches it | `CPROC:2498` |
| 9 | **M** | `umask` is implemented and unreachable | `CPROC:3301` |
| 10 | **M** | Two verifiers carry a dead ANSI strip | `gplbld` |
| 11 | **B** | ***Nested `commit` silently loses the outer transaction's writes*** — UPSTREAM #17, **unfixed here** | `gplsrc/txn.c` |
| 12 | **S** | Error 3023 tells the user the disk may be full — UPSTREAM #20, **unfixed here** | `sdsys/messages/1407` |
| 13 | **M** | `qselect` prints its message without the list number — UPSTREAM #21, **unfixed here** | `gpl.bp/QSELECT:240` |
| 14 | **S** | `delete.file ... no.query` still prompts, so it cannot run unattended — UPSTREAM #23, **unfixed here** | `gpl.bp/DELETEF:222` |
| 15 | **M** | `delete.index` will not match a lower-case index name, though `list.index` will — UPSTREAM #22, **unfixed here** | `gpl.bp/DELETEI:155` |
| 16 | **S** | A killed session blocks exclusive access, says nothing about why, and only an administrator can clear it | `gplsrc/sd.c:333` |
| ~~17~~ | **B** | ~~`edit` / `micro` refuse a record whose text looks like a mark token~~ — **DONE 27 Aug 2026** | `sdsys/gpl.bp/EDIT` |
| ~~18~~ | **M** | ~~A text mark reaches the editor as a raw control character~~ — **DONE 27 Aug 2026** | `sdsys/gpl.bp/EDIT` |

***UPSTREAM #18 AND #19 ARE FIXED IN THIS TREE*** and are deliberately not
listed above — `op_config.c` and `op_skt.c`, both 26 Aug 2026, each citing its
UPSTREAM_FIXES number in its own history block. **They are the reason 11 to 13
are worth stating separately**: four upstream defects were found while
documenting, two were fixed here and two were not, and nothing recorded which
was which.

---

## 3. The live `SDSYS` VOC does not match `voc_template` — **S**

Measured 26 Aug 2026 while writing the query-processor page.

| | |
|---|---|
| `%L` `%G` `%E` and the two-character forms | **ship in `voc_template` and in `newvoc`, and are ABSENT from the live `SDSYS` voc.** `ct voc %L` answers *Record '%L' not found* |
| `=` | **is in the live `SDSYS` voc** as `K` / `25`, and is in **neither** `newvoc` nor `voc_template` |

So the `%`-form comparison operators do not work in `SDSYS`:
`count voc with dispatch %L "I"` returns `0 record(s) counted` and two *not
found* complaints, where `lt`, `<` and `before` all return 381.

**`<` and `>` cannot be VOC records on this port at all** — they are illegal
NTFS file names, and `newvoc` and `voc_template` are directory files. They work
anyway, so the parser is not taking them from the VOC. That is worth
understanding before changing anything here.

***UNTESTED AND IT MATTERS: a user account is built from `newvoc` by `CREATEA`,
which copies every record, so a user account probably DOES get the `%` forms and
`SDSYS` does not.*** No standard account survived the suite teardown, so this
was not measured. The published operator table lists only spellings that were
run.

## 4. Tester page 07 says a standard account has 77 verbs — **S**

It has **81**. `Testing/markdown/07-programmer-commands.md` opens with the
wrong number, and page 06 repeats it.

**77 is a count of VOC records whose field 1 begins with `V`.** It misses the
four records that are a keyword *and* a verb — `break`, `count`, `display`,
`off` — whose fields 3 onward are a complete verb record. `CPROC:1718`
re-parses from field 3, so all four are typeable, and none is on
`TIER.OMIT.STANDARD`.

**Confirmed three ways.** `CREATEA:961`-`996` copies every `newvoc` record
except the two list records and, for a standard tier, the 42 omitted names —
with no filter on record type, so 123 − 42 = 81. SD's own VOC dictionary
encodes the same rule in its I-type `DISPATCH` field. And
`count voc with dispatch # ""` answers **144** in `SDSYS`, matching a file scan
of the shipped tree exactly (`CA` 97, `IN` 45, `OS` 2).

## 5. `.d name` cannot find a lower-case VOC record typed in upper case — **S**

`CPROC:1119` tries the name as typed and then `upcase` only. `.l` (`CPROC:1176`)
and `.r` (`CPROC:1204`) try as typed, then `downcase`, then `upcase`.

So a paragraph saved as `daily` can be listed and recalled by typing `DAILY`
and **cannot be deleted** by typing `DAILY`.

**Ours, not upstream's** — upstream `CPROC` has **0** `downcase` calls and this
port's has 15, so §5.12's fold missed a site. It is not among the four the
section records as left deliberately.

**Second, smaller fault at the same place:** if both reads fail, `voc.rec` keeps
its previous value and is then tested for `S`/`PA`, and there is no *not found*
message on this path — `.l` has one (sysmsg 5043) and `.d` does not.

## 6. An empty directory called `C:` is created in the data tree — **S**

`C:\ProgramData\SD\sdsys\C:` exists, is empty, and is stamped **26 Aug 2026
21:17:46 — twenty-four seconds into the 21:17:22 install**. So the installer
makes it, not a running session.

Consistent with the POSIX-versus-Windows path confusion that stopped the editors
working: something built a path from a drive-letter fragment and created it
relative to the data tree. **Chase it in `sd.iss` / `finish-install.ps1`, not in
the interpreter.**

## 7. `sort.item` is withheld from a standard account and `list.item` is not — **M**

`sort.item` is on `newvoc/TIER.OMIT.STANDARD`; `list.item` is not. Both print
whole records field by field, so withholding one and not the other achieves
nothing. **Looks like an oversight in the list rather than a decision** — worth
confirming, because if it was deliberate the reason should be written down.

## 8. `help` is an empty stub and F1 reaches it — **M**

Internal verb 14. `CPROC:2498`'s body is entirely commented out and it returns
immediately; `f1.help` at `:2500` falls into the same empty routine, so **F1 at
the command prompt does nothing.** No VOC record in `newvoc` or `voc_template`
points at verb 14, so the name is not recognised either — measured:
`help is not in your VOC`.

**Decide whether F1 should say something** rather than silently doing nothing.
The documentation is the help system now, and the pages say so.

## 9. `umask` is implemented and unreachable — **M**

Internal verb 35. `CPROC:3301` is a working routine that reports or sets the
file-creation mask, and **no VOC record points at it**, so it cannot be typed —
measured: `umask is not in your VOC`. `umask()` from SD BASIC still works.

Either ship a VOC record for it or delete the routine; a working verb nobody can
reach is the kind of thing that reads as a missing feature.

## 10. Two verifiers carry a dead ANSI strip — **M**

`gplbld/probe-catprivate.ps1:165` and `gplbld/verify-catgate.ps1:133` both hold
``$out -replace "`e\[[0-9]*[A-Za-z]"``. **`` `e `` is not an escape in Windows
PowerShell 5.1**, so the pattern is the literal letter `e` and strips nothing.

**Already recorded** — PROJECT_STATUS.md §6 says every ANSI strip in `gplbld` is
dead code and names `verify-nocase.ps1` and `verify-tiers.ps1` as carrying it
harmlessly; these two were not on that list. `verify-osusers.ps1` does it
correctly with `[char]27`.

Not shipped, so it costs nothing at release — but it silently mis-scores any
check whose anchor spans an escape sequence, and it did exactly that on
26 Aug 2026 before the raw output was read.

# UPSTREAM DEFECTS WE STILL SHIP

**The analysis is in [UPSTREAM_FIXES.md](UPSTREAM_FIXES.md) and is not repeated
here.** What these entries add is the only thing that file does not say:
***whether our own tree still carries it.*** Checked against the source, not
remembered.

## 11. Nested `commit` silently loses the outer transaction's writes — **B**

**UPSTREAM_FIXES #17. Live in this tree, verified 26 Aug 2026:** `txn_depth` is
incremented at `gplsrc/txn.c:96` and decremented at `:592`, and `op_txncmt()`
does **neither** — it touches neither `txn_depth` nor the transaction stack.

***THIS IS THE ONE THAT MATTERS ON THE WHOLE LIST.*** It is silent partial data
loss inside the one construct whose entire purpose is that there is no such
thing, and `system(1008)` climbs for ever so nothing reports it.

***DO NOT FIX HALF OF IT.*** Decrementing `txn_depth` in `op_txncmt()` would
make `system(1008)` trustworthy while the data-loss path stayed, which is worse
than both being visibly wrong. The owner has it in front of him and the
sequencing is his.

## 12. Error 3023 tells the user the disk may be full — **S**

**UPSTREAM_FIXES #20. Live in this tree, verified 26 Aug 2026** — our
`sdsys/messages/1407` still reads:

```
Error %d (o/s %d) writing record (Possible full disk?)
```

Error **3023** is *"write/delete with no lock"*, so the first application to
wrap a working `WRITE` in a transaction without locking first is sent to check
disk space. **Ships in the message file, so it costs no rebuild** — the fix is
a second message id special-cased at the call site, leaving 1407 accurate for
the disk-full case it was written for.

## 13. `qselect` prints its message without the list number — **M**

**UPSTREAM_FIXES #21. Live in this tree, measured 26 Aug 2026** —
`gpl.bp/QSELECT:240` passes one argument to a two-parameter message, so every
successful `qselect` ends with a dangling *"select list "*. `NSELECT:112` two
files away supplies both and is the model. One line, and `tgt.list` is already
in hand on the line above.

Documented as a known blemish in the select-lists page so a reader does not go
looking for a list that is there.

## 14. `delete.file ... no.query` still prompts — **S**

**UPSTREAM_FIXES #23. Live in this tree, measured 26 Aug 2026** —
`gpl.bp/DELETEF:222` and `:297` call `check.sdsys.file` with no `no.query`
guard, and that subroutine prompts unconditionally.

***IT COST A SESSION THE DAY IT WAS FOUND.*** `delete.file zzak force no.query`
was issued down a pipe on the strength of `no.query`, hit the system-account
prompt, ate the following commands as answers and hung; killing it left a
user-table slot that needed an elevated `sd -cleanup` to clear. **Anything that
drives SD non-interactively is exposed** — a build script, a test harness, the
verify suite.

The safe branch already exists: `N` deletes the VOC reference and leaves the
system file alone. Honouring `no.query` by taking it, or refusing the
combination up front, both beat a prompt nobody can answer.

## 15. `delete.index` will not match a lower-case index name — **M**

**UPSTREAM_FIXES #22. Live in this tree, measured 26 Aug 2026** —
`gpl.bp/DELETEI:155` compares with an exact `locate` against names held upper
case, where `gpl.bp/LISTI:147` upcases both sides first. So `list.index zzak f1`
finds the index and `delete.index zzak f1` answers *"Unrecognised index name
(f1)"*.

**Worth a look alongside item 5**, `.d name` in `CPROC` — different files,
different authors, same shape: two commands that should agree about a name and
one of them folds case. Whatever policy is settled for one should settle the
other.

## 16. A killed session blocks exclusive access, explains nothing, and only an administrator can clear it — **S**

***THIS ONE IS OURS, AND IT FOLLOWS FROM OUR OWN HARDENING.*** Upstream's
`-CLEANUP` runs unguarded (`sdb64 gplsrc/sd.c:297`); ours calls `check_admin()`
first (`gplsrc/sd.c:333`), which asks `IsElevated()`. That was the 15 Aug 2026
decision to gate every administrative switch, and **the reasoning still looks
right** — `cleanup()` acts on everybody's sessions. What was not considered is
what an ordinary user does afterwards.

**The chain, all of it measured on 26 Aug 2026:**

| | |
|---|---|
| a session dies without logging out | its user-table slot survives; `listu` still lists it |
| `build.index` on a file it had open | *"Cannot gain exclusive access to file"* — **in a session that never opened the file** |
| `logout` *n* | *"Force logout initiated"*, then the entry reads **`(logout pending)` for ever** — logout signals a process that no longer exists |
| `sd -cleanup` | clears it, and **requires elevation** |
| `logout` itself | is an **administrator** verb, so it is not a programmer's route either |

***THE MESSAGE IS THE WORST PART.*** *"Cannot gain exclusive access to file"*
points at the file. Nothing points at a dead session, and the user has no reason
to run `listu` — which is administrator-only anyway. **A programmer whose ssh
connection drops cannot fix their own `build.index`, and cannot find out why.**
Dropped connections are routine over ssh, which is the access route this port is
built around.

**Two independent things to decide, and they are separable:**

1. **Diagnosis.** The refusal could name the session holding the file, the way
   `sdprobe2.ps1` requires a contender to name the holder before a lock
   measurement counts. That is useful even when the holder is alive.
2. **Recovery.** Either let `logout` *n* reap a slot whose process is gone
   instead of marking it pending for ever, or give an unprivileged user some
   way to clear their own dead session. `-CLEANUP` acting on everybody is a
   fair reason to keep its gate; it is not a reason to leave the user stuck.

***AND THE AUTOMATIC SWEEP DOES NOT RECOVER IT. MEASURED 26 Aug 2026.***
`sdwind`'s `check_lost_users()` is supposed to find an entry whose process is
gone — `kill(pid, 0)` — every five minutes and shell out to `sd -cleanup`.

**User 58, pid 363, logged in 22:57, was still listed by `listu` at 23:07** with
`sdwind` running throughout. **Ten minutes is at least two full sweep
intervals**, so this is not a case of not having waited: the entry outlived the
mechanism meant to remove it, and was cleared only by an elevated `sd -cleanup`
run by hand.

*(An earlier draft of this entry said the sweep had not been given long enough
to judge, which was true of the first stale entry — watched about four minutes
— and is not true of this one.)*

**So there is no automatic recovery, not merely an awkward manual one.** That
raises the cost of everything above: the user cannot fix it, cannot diagnose it,
and waiting does not help either.

**What is still open is WHY**, and PROJECT_STATUS §6 already says not to guess
between the two candidates — `sd -cleanup` misjudging, or `kill(pid, 0)`
answering wrongly for an MSYS2 pid. **That question is now worth answering**,
because the same §6 entry records the sweep on 22 Aug 2026 doing the opposite
and forcing out healthy sessions for twenty minutes. A sweep that misses dead
entries and evicts live ones is one bug or two, and nobody has looked.

## DONE

## 1. The `edit` / `micro` refusal message is malformed — **B** — DONE 27 Aug 2026

Reported by the owner, 26 Aug 2026; seen again by him on 27 Aug in the refusal
that raised item 17.

`check.permitted` built a multi-line refusal by concatenating `char(10)` — a
bare LF — and `EDIT` printed the whole thing with **one** `crt`. Eight sites
built text that way. A bare LF advances a line without returning to column 0,
so every line after the first started where the previous one ended:

```
:edit bp test
edit is not available to don.
                            It runs an editor outside SD, so it needs OS.EXECUTE permission: field 2 of your record in
the SD system file os.users, which only an administrator can change.
                                                                    ed, the line editor, needs none of this.
```

**A pipe hides it**, which is why it survived: down a pipe the LF *is* the
separator and the same message reads perfectly.

***FIXED AT THE ONE PRINT SITE, NOT THE EIGHT BUILDERS.*** `end.program` now
splits `error.text` on `char(10)` and writes one `crt` per line. That is the
fix for the class rather than for the message: a message written next year
cannot reintroduce it.

**Not verified on a console yet** — it is compiled BASIC and wants a cycle.

## 17. `edit` / `micro` refuse a record whose text looks like a mark token — **B** — DONE 27 Aug 2026

Reported by the owner, 27 Aug 2026, editing a source record in `SDSYS`:

```
This record cannot be edited with micro.
Its text and the ~~ and ~` marks cannot be told apart, so saving it would
change data you did not edit.
ed, the line editor, handles it without any of this.
```

His ruling with it: ***"the whole purpose of these editors is primarily to edit
source code without having to use ED... the conversion of field, value and
subvalue marks needs to be handled seamlessly, just like CRLF or LF."***

**The guard was doing what it was written to do.** `process.record` converted
`@vm` to `~~` and `@sm` to `` ~` ``, converted back, and refused any record
where the two differed. Three kinds of text tripped it: a literal `~~`, a
literal `` ~` ``, or a `~` immediately before a mark.

***AND `sdsys/gpl.bp/EDIT` WAS THE ONLY SOURCE RECORD IN THE SHIPPED TREE THAT
IT REFUSED.*** Measured across `sdsys` and `user_accounts`: the only other hits
are `gcat` and `gpl.bp.out` object records, which nobody edits. **The program
refused itself, because it carries the token strings as constants.**

**The fix is an escape character.** `~` now escapes, and a tilde is written
`~-` **only where the next character would make the pair look like a token** —
another `~`, a backtick, a `-`, `@vm` or `@sm`. Everywhere else it is left
alone, so `a~b` is still `a~b` in the editor and ordinary source reads
normally. `marks.out` in `EDIT`. *(It was
`escape.tildes` and three `change()` calls for about an hour; item 18 added a
third mark and the run separator the same day, and the decode had to become a
left-to-right scan — a separator is a token that exists only by virtue of where
it sits, and `change()` has no notion of where it is.)*

**The round-trip check stays** and is now expected never to fire; if it does,
that is a defect in `EDIT` rather than a property of the record, and its
message says so.

***PROVED BEFORE THE CYCLE, NOT AFTER.*** `gplbld/test-edittokens-units.py`
runs the same algorithm over **every string up to six characters** drawn from
`~`, `` ` ``, `-`, `@vm`, `@sm` and one ordinary letter — **55,987 of them, 0
lossy** — and over **all 197 shipped `gpl.bp` records, 17 of which contain a
tilde, 0 lossy**. It asserts the corpus contains tildes, because a lossless
answer over records with no tilde in them would be true and would prove
nothing.

**Not upstream.** `sdb64`'s `GPL.BP/MICRO` does no mark conversion at all —
see UPSTREAM_FIXES #16, fault 4, added the same day.

**Not verified on a console yet** — it is compiled BASIC and wants a cycle.

## 18. A text mark reaches the editor as a raw control character — **M** — DONE 27 Aug 2026

Found 27 Aug 2026 while correcting the changelog for item 17, and **the entry it
corrected was itself wrong**: the changelog said text marks were *"covered by
that same refusal rather than being left to surprise you"*, and they never were.
The round trip only converted `@vm` and `@sm`, so a record containing `@tm`
converted to itself, compared equal, and passed the guard untouched. It then
went to the editor as `x'FB'`.

***THE OWNER ADDED THE MARK THE SAME DAY.*** `~!` is a text mark, and it is
`~!` rather than his first proposal `` `~ `` because he spotted that a token led
by a backtick breaks the rule that every token starts with `~` — which would
make the backtick a second escape-introducing character needing its own escape.

**And with three marks the runs needed separating.** Consecutive marks are now
written with a comma between their tokens — `~!,~!,~~` — because token against
token they cannot be read. A literal comma standing in exactly that position is
written `~,`.

Proved the same way as item 17, over an alphabet that now includes `!`, `,` and
`@tm`: exhaustive to length 6 in the routine test and **once to length 7,
5,380,840 strings, none lost.**

## 2. The installing user gets no `OS.EXECUTE` — **B** — DONE 27 Aug 2026

Owner's instruction, 26 Aug 2026 and again on the 27th: administrators are to
*"have access to os.execute, ssh and api by default without escalating"*.

***TWO OF THE THREE ALREADY HELD, AND THAT WAS RE-MEASURED RATHER THAN
QUOTED.*** `CREATEA` gives an ADMINISTRATOR both routes and no keyword can take
either away (21 Aug 2026); `MODIFY.ACCOUNT` refuses to remove them for the same
reason (10083). Checked live on this install, 27 Aug: `Get-LocalGroupMember`
shows `don` — the ADMINISTRATOR-tier account the installer adopted — in **both
`sdssh` and `sdapi`**.

**`OS.EXECUTE` was the one that did not**, and `C:\ProgramData\SD\sdsys\os.users`
held **0 records** on a fresh install, so nobody had it. Both gates that read
that list — `CPROC`'s `sh` gate on field 1, and `op_sh.c`'s `os_permitted()` on
field 2, which is also what `EDIT`'s `check.permitted` reads — fall back to
*elevation*, and an unelevated administrator is an ordinary user by design
(`kernel.c`: *"An administrator who has not elevated is an ordinary SD user,
exactly as on Linux"*). That is why he met *"edit is not available to don"*.

**The fix is one place: `CREATEA`'s new `grant.os.access`.** An
ADMINISTRATOR-tier **USER** account is written into `os.users` as it is created
— ADOPT included, so the installing user gets it — with **both** fields `yes`.

***IT IS DATA, NOT A SECOND GATE, AND THAT IS THE PART WORTH KEEPING.*** The
26 Aug ruling had a second half: teach `EDIT`'s `check.permitted` the
ADMINISTRATOR tier as well. **That was deliberately not done.** One list already
answers *"may this person reach the operating system"*; it is readable and
editable; a tier test beside it would make the answer depend on two things that
can disagree, and `os.users` is keyed by **person** while a tier belongs to an
**account**, so the two do not even ask the same question. The cost of the
narrower choice: an administrator whose record is deleted or set to `no` **is**
refused, rather than the tier overriding. That reads as correct — a default that
can be edited — but it is a narrowing of the earlier ruling and is flagged as
one.

**Both fields, not only field 2.** They are the two halves of one capability —
field 1 is the `sh` verb and `!`, field 2 is `OS.EXECUTE` from a program and the
editors. Granting one and not the other would leave an administrator able to run
`os.execute` from BASIC and refused at the prompt.

**And `DELETE.ACCOUNT` takes it away again**, but only where SD is deleting the
Windows login itself: the record is keyed by the person, so removing it for a
login that survives would take a permission from somebody who still has a reason
to hold it. Without that, the verify suite would leave one behind every run.

**Not verified** — it is compiled BASIC and wants a cycle. After one, `os.users`
should hold a `don` record with two `yes` fields.
