#
# WHY THIS EXISTS AS CODE RATHER THAN A RULE.  CLAUDE.md has required since
# 15 Aug 2026 that a test cycle begin with a fresh install, and the rule was
# still broken twice on 15 Aug 2026 - both times in the same way, and neither
# time by ignoring it.  The rule says when a cycle BEGINS and says nothing
# about what ENDS one, so "install, start testing, edit source, keep reading
# results" passes it while producing measurements of a tree that no longer
# exists.  The two cases:
#
#   * sd.iss was edited after the installer was built, and the run in flight
#     carried on being read afterwards.
#   * GPL.BP/OS_GROUP was hand-recompiled into the installed tree and
#     LIST.GRANTS then measured on it.
#
# A result from a stale tree is worse than no result: it looks like evidence.
# PROJECT_STATUS.md section 6 records what that has already cost.
#
# THE BIAS IS DELIBERATE.  A false "stale" costs one install; a false "current"
# costs an investigation of a bug that was fixed hours ago.  So touching a file
# without changing it fails this check, and that is the right way round.
#
# HASHING sd.exe IS NOT ENOUGH ON ITS OWN, which is the trap this is really
# for.  Most changes in this project are BASIC, messages, dictionaries and the
# installer script - none of which touch sd.exe.  A guard that compared only
# the binary would have passed, cheerfully, through every stale test today.
